“Hey Josh,

Sean Blanda here, managing editor of 99u.com. I’ve been following your work and really enjoy your email newsletter. We’re trying to launch something similar here at 99U, and I’d like to talk to you about any advice you’d have for us.

Are you up for a coffee meeting sometime next week at the Midtown Starbucks? I’m available Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 11-2 each day. Hope to hear from you!

has literally been a godsend for me
was wondering if you were up for me treating you to a cup of coffee in exchange for some insight
I know you’re a super busy guy, but I would be very grateful for 20 minutes of your time and am happy to meet you at the most convenient location/time for you.

4. Offer to pay. : Ask the other person what they’d like before placing your order. Then, pay for both. It was your idea to meet and grab coffee, it’s only fair that you cover the (admittedly minor) costs. If you’re a student, chances are they wont let you actually pay, but offer any way. If the person objects and wants to pay for their coffee, let them. Don’t spend more than five seconds on this interaction. 



“Hey Josh, it was great to meet you, thanks for being so generous with your time. To follow up on some of the things I mentioned:
    This is the video of my favorite 99U talk
    That restaurant I like by your house is called Stoops, here’s the Yelp link.
    Here is a link to that blog post I wrote that I told you about.
Also, you mentioned you had a contact at firm x? I’d love to speak with her, let me know if I can provide you with anything to make this easier.
Thanks again,
–Sean”

9. Offer to end on time. : It’s likely you agreed to meet for 15 or 30 minutes. As those times approach, even if you are in the middle of a fruitful conversation, stop and ask the person if they have to go. If they agree to keep chatting, great. If your reminder kept them on schedule, even better. Be someone who respects the time of others.
